# Customer-Churn-Prediction-System
Building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that can predict customer churn based on behavioral, transactional, and demographic data. The goal is to identify customers likely to discontinue a service and generate actionable business insights.

This project predicts customer churn using various machine learning models. It analyzes customer behavior based on features like credit score, balance, age, and activity. The system includes preprocessing, feature engineering and model training for real-time predictions. The final output is a CSV file containing predicted churn results with key customer details.
